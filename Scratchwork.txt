Idea:
        Build a calculator that takes in dino and turret data and then returns soaking data such as bullets soaked per minute, estimated time to soak, amount able to soak before needing to heal

Goals:
        Organized, proper file structure lolt
        Optimized well, no crashing (introduce catches for improper responses or edge cases)
        Allow a user to input the time to soak 1 turret in minutes and gget an estimated bullet count returned
        Cover all soaking dinos + reapers, diplo, etc
        Cover all buffs and combinations of buffs
        cover healing
